MW shiftpattern Port Install Instructions [Attribulator + OGVI only]

This is only required for Improvement Mod v2 users, or if you have installed the 240sx optional script. 
The C6R and (Improvement Mod v2) and the Tier 3 version of the 240sx use shiftpatterns from MW.

If you're not an Improvement Mod user, and you don't have the 240sx Tier 3 script installed, you can skip step entirely.

If you've already installed MW shiftpattern Port, you wont need to install it again, 
you can skip this step.

I've kept it as a separate Installer, so you don't get an 
annoying error message saying "add_node failed because collection already exists" every time you update it.

An Un-Installer with instructions is also Included.


1. Open up OGVI

2. Press File>Import ModScript and import "MW shiftpattern Port Installer [OGVI]"

3. Select "Install"

4. Press "Import"

5. Save Changes and Exit.



Was designed for/completely compatible with:

- Vanilla NFSC
- Vanilla NFSC with upgradeable Bonus Cars (Does not add them, only accounts for them)
- Vanilla NFSC, Add Upgradeable Bonus Cars.
- Improvement Mod v2 by 379Felipe.
- Ultimate Mod by Ratt.


Was not 100% designed for, but can technically be installed on-top of: (may or may not get some errors, idk?)

- Any kind of Modpack (eg. Redux).

- Pretty much anything that supports VltEd or OGVI really. At the very least, in pretty much any build of Carbon, all of the non-bonus cars WILL get their stated changes.

*If you're unsure which one to select, Vanilla with Upgradeable Bonus Cars is probably the safest option.


CANNOT be Installed on-top of:

- Carbon Battle Royale

- Any kind of online client for NFS Carbon.


Permissions Granted to:
- Use and Include this in your Modpack.
- Use and or Include aspects of this mod in your Modpack.
  (for example, using this as a base, and then applying your own tweaks and adjustments)
