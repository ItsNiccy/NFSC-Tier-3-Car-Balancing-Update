BMW:

M3 GTR (Race)
Even with it's 'weaker' engine, the Carbon M3 GTR still has a better Power/Weight ratio
than it's MW counterpart, along with having better handling.
The MW version also didn't have induction upgrades by default 
(induction nodes do exist for M3 GTR Race, but is unused in the vanilla game)
Taking everything into account, It's still faster than the MW version. 
I MIGHT further reduce its Boost values in the future, 
but I'm only doing small, incremental changes for now.

Why such a massive disclaimer for such a small change??????
Well, while it is a legendary car IRL, it has, to put it kindly,
a very "interesting and passionate" fanbase.

 The Carbon version weighs 200kg less than the MW counterpart (1100kg for C, 1300kg for MW), has access to induction upgrades and has better handling.

*there are already mods that port the MW M3 GTR Performance over to Carbon, if that's what you want.
